    Print "What is your age? "
    scanner takes the input from the user
    'age' stores the input from user

    'minAgeLegal' stores the legal age to drive which is 16 or older.

    We are using the ternary operator:
    If 'age' is equal or greater than the legal age to drive
        true: print "You are old enough to legally drive.
        false: You are not old enough to legally drive.
